# LiveEarth
A plugin which works with Terra++ worlds to give players the live, real world weather of the place they are currently standing in to them in game. (Liveweather).

It does the same with time by reading sunrise and sunset in from the API of the lcoation they are standing in and using the current time to position the sun in the correct place. (Livetime).

A "Live" mode aims to make the experience as close to real life as possible by giving a player a specific resource pack, setting their gamemode to adventure, setting their walk speed to 0.7 and turning liveweather and livetime on.

All of these features are toogleable by the player and can also be toogled by server admins.
